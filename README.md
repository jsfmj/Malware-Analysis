# Malware-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and reverse engineering malware samples to uncover their behavior and potential threats. The analysis was conducted using a variety of tools to extract valuable insights from obfuscated malware and packed executables.

Used tools such as HxD, Hashmyfiles, Xorsearch, Exeinfo PE and floss for static malware analysis. 
Used tools such as wireshark, regshot and procmon for dynamic malware analysis.

Project Goals: The goal of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of how malware operates, how it obfuscates its actions, and how to extract meaningful insights from such samples to better protect systems from malicious threats.

Static analysis
